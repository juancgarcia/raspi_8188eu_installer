A quick-n-dirty shell script based on the work on this forum
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=62371

Automates a bit more of the process, and avoids the copy-paste dance.

Just run the script and reboot when prompted. That's it.

The script scrapes that forum page for your kernels version to determine the right download file and installs the driver.
(this obviously requires a connection to the internet via ethernet, or possibly a loaner wifi dongle that is natively supported)


Cheers.
